# I Ching Oracle

This is the old project from 2016 and it has not been developed since. The app implements several methods from Plum Blossom I Ching (PB).
With PB you can take "randomness" directly from the question you what to consult I Ching about,
it does not require outside source of random input, like tossing a coin for instance.

You can develop your own methods as plugins as well as provide your own texts for trigrams and hexagrams.
